# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Prompt Engineering Projects Portfolio!  
This repository showcases real-world prompt engineering projects demonstrating modular system design, hallucination mitigation, user-centric dialogue, chain-of-thought prompting, and production-grade QA processes.

Each project is structured as a standalone mini-case study, including:

- Project Overview
- Key Skills Demonstrated
- Step-by-Step Execution Process
- QA Iterations
- Final Outputs
- Lessons Learned

---
